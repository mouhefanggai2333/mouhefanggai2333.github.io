I'm a master's student in the third year from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and point cloud coding.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kai Huang](https://www.usilab.cn/) of XXX Lab from [School of Computer Science and Engineering]([https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/]), Sun Yat-sen University.
